benchmark_config
================

The ``benchmark_config.json`` file contains the simulation setup, when using the Python API of BeRfiPl.
Besides the description of the employed modules and their interconnection, a description of the employed products and their transformation is included.
The ``benchmark_config.json`` includes the setup the create BeRfiPl, but of course individual setups can also be defined.

      "ds1": {
         "model": {
            "nodes": ["mixer_partial0", "source0", "source1", "source2", "sink0"],
            "edges": [["source0", "mixer_partial0"], ["source1", "mixer_partial0"], ["source2", "mixer_partial0"], ["mixer_partial0", "sink0"]]},
         "faults": ["l", "c", "lc"],
         "faulty_module": ["mixer_partial0"],
         "ProdIn": ["red", "yellow", "blue"],
         "ProdOut": ["redyellowblue"],
         "startTime": 0,
         "stopTime": 4000,

         }
   }


The config file contains a dictionary, which includes:
    - The dataset name
        In this case ``ds1``. The name can be customized.
    - The configuration
        The configuration of the Cyber-Physical Process Plants is noted in the form of a directed graph under ``model``.
        Under ``nodes`` all employed modules in the custom setup have to be listed as strings.
        Under ``edges`` the directed connections between the employed modules have to be listed as tuples in list form.

        **Important: Every input and output of a module must be connected. If there is no preceding or succeeding module, place a source or sink, respectively.**

        **Important: The modules have to be indexed! Modules without an index will cause errors in the compilation of the simulation.**

   - The Faults
        Under ``faults`` one of three employable faults can be added to the simulation.
        Each element in the list will create a new dataset, which will contain the employed fault.
        If ``""`` is added to the list, a fault-free dataset will be generated.
        The fault cases are:
            - ``""`` : no faults.
            - ``"l"`` : a leakage will be induced. The leakage will purge some of the volume flow into a sink outside the system
            - ``"c"`` : a clogging will be induced. The clogging will reduce the diameter of a pipe within a module and lead to an increase in pressure.
            - ``"lc"`` : a leakage and a clogging will be induced. The named effects will be included superposed within the dataset.
   - The faulty module
        Under ``faulty_module`` the faulty module can be selected. The name must match a module name (with index!) from the ``model:nodes`` list.
   - Input products & output products
        Under ``ProdIn`` and ``ProdOut`` a list of the input products and output products of the Cyber-Physical Process Plant is given.
        The names of the products can be customized. We suggest colors ``red``, ``yellow``, and ``blue``.
        Additionally, adjectives, like ``*_bottled``, ``*_distilled``, or proportions like ``*_0.8`` can be added.
        Optionally, product descriptions in any variety can be added. This feature mainly focuses on the planning aspect of the dataset.
   - Simulation start time
      ``startTime`` is ndicating the time from which the simulation is going to generate data.
        (Standard value: 0)
   - Simulation stop time
      ``stopTime`` is indicating the time the simulation will be stopped.
        (Standard value: 4000)
   - Number of intervals
      ``numberOfIntervalls`` is indicating the number of intervals that will be simulated, or indirectly the sampling rate.
        (Standard value: 40000)
   - Fault induction
      Under ``errorInduction`` the time your error will be induced can be chosen.

      The time **must** always be smaller than your simulation stop time.

Once you adapted the config file, save it under ``benchmark_config.json`` in JSON format.
