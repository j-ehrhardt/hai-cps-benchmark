# Datasets

The HAI-CPS benchmark constist of a total of 10 Datasets showing increasing system complexity

Each dataset is available in four recording modes: 
- **normal discrete**: Includes only binary/discrete control and sensor values with its states of the normal working system.
- **anomalous discrete**: Includes only binary/discrete control and sensor values with its states of the non-normal working system.
- **normal continuous**: Includes only real-valued sensor data and process measurements with its states of the normal working system.
- **anomalous continuous**: Includes only real-valued sensor data and process measurements with its states of the normal working system.

Within each recording mode all anomalies in all modules and all their permutations are saved as a separate `.csv` file, along with a recording of without any anomaly, to foster unsupervised ML methods. 

The naming convention of the channels within the recordings follows the schema `<module><component><sensor>`. 

The recordings of HAI-CPS are structured as follows: 
```bash
